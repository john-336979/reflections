How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	it put the different lines on top of each other so it was easy to spot

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	allow you to go back to previous, working copies of the source code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	all the options presented

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Git is for programmers that use multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log provides a summary of changes and their ID's
    git diff provides the details between two different changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	I would not worry experimenting, since I can always go back to a version of code that worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    	writing programs; taking notes
